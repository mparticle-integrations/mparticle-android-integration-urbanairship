### Adding the integration

1. Add the kit dependency to your app's build.gradle:

    ```groovy
    dependencies {
        compile 'com.mparticle:android-urbanairship-kit:4+'
    }
    ```
2. Follow the mParticle Android SDK [quick-start](https://github.com/mParticle/mparticle-android-sdk), then rebuild and launch your app, and verify that you see `"Urban Airship detected"` in the output of `adb logcat`.

#### Push Message Considerations

The Urban Airship sdk come with a dependency for Google Play Services, version 9.8.0. since Google services often depend of Google Play Services, it is important to keep consistent versions across Google service dependencies. Please be sure to use the following dependencies for GCM or FCM services

  ##### GCM
  ```
  compile "com.google.android.gms:play-services-gcm:9.8.0"
  ```

  ##### FCM
  ```
  compile 'com.google.firebase:firebase-messaging:9.8.0'
  ```
